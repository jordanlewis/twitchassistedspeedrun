- load/save stuff gated by channel points?
- number of frames per input dependent on
  number of people typing at once
- writing down inputs on screen so you can see
  whether your inputs are doing anything or not

- Playback mode?
  - once we make it to the end of a level, instead of
    just returning to the overworld we should replay
    all of the collected inputs before returning control
    to twitch.
  - would also be cool to upload the finished input
    script somewhere and post the link so people can
    mess with it.
  - or use twitch api to auto clip the winning run

- Prevent people from loading savestates that are too
  far in the past because of trolls
- Potentially rate limit people loading save states?

- fix bug where commands don't work right after you load
  a savestate
